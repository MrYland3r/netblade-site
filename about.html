We are a small start-up dedicated to making web browsing smooth, enjoyable, and user-friendly across the board for corporations. Our goal is to create innovative digital solutions that enhance the way people interact with the internet, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for all.
Founded in 2025, our company started as a college project among six broke college students who were tired of checking for malicious websites and even IPs, and wanted a better way to focus on what really matters. We set out to develop a simple yet powerful solution: an app that intelligently blocks unwanted websites, allowing users to stay on track and enjoy a seamless web experience
